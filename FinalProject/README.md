# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Final Project

## Project Overview

This project is designed to help you build a **complete, professional EDA pipeline** similar to what is expected in internships, research roles, and data science interviews.

You will **choose your own dataset**, perform structured exploratory analysis, extract meaningful insights, and communicate results clearly.

## Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Structure a real-world EDA project end-to-end
- Clean and analyze raw datasets
- Perform univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis
- Identify correlations, trends, and outliers
- Engineer useful features
- Draw actionable conclusions and recommendations
- Present insights visually and clearly

---

## Dataset Selection (Your Choice)

You are free to choose **any dataset**, provided it meets the following criteria:

### Dataset Requirements

- At least **1,000 rows** (recommended)
- At least **10+ columns**
- Must include:

  - Numerical features
  - Categorical features

- Should allow **interesting analysis** (trends, patterns, comparisons)

### Suggested Sources

- Kaggle
- Government open data portals
- Company / product datasets
- Sports, finance, health, education, climate, or social data

  **Avoid** toy or overly-clean datasets with no scope for analysis.

## **IF YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO FIND A DATASET THEN USE THE heart_disease_uci.csv FILE**

## Project Structure (What Your EDA Must Include)

### 1️. Problem Definition

- Briefly describe:

  - What the dataset is about
  - Why it is interesting
  - What questions you want to answer

---

### 2️. Data Loading

- Load the dataset using appropriate libraries
- Display basic information:

  - Shape of the data
  - Column names
  - Data types

---

### 3️. Data Cleaning

- Handle:

  - Missing values
  - Duplicate records
  - Incorrect data types
  - Inconsistent or invalid entries

- Clearly explain **why** you made each cleaning decision

---

### 4️. Univariate Analysis

- Analyze **individual features**
- Examples:

  - Distribution of numerical variables
  - Frequency of categorical variables

- Use plots and summary statistics

---

### 5️. Bivariate Analysis

- Study relationships between **two variables**
- Examples:

  - Numerical vs numerical
  - Numerical vs categorical
  - Categorical vs categorical

---

### 6️. Multivariate Analysis

- Analyze interactions among **multiple variables**
- Examples:

  - Group-based comparisons
  - Combined feature effects
  - Advanced visualizations

---

### 7️. Correlation Study

- Compute correlations between numerical features
- Identify:

  - Strong positive correlations
  - Strong negative correlations
  - Redundant features

- Visualize using appropriate plots

---

### 8️. Outlier Detection

- Detect outliers using:

  - Statistical methods
  - Visualization-based methods

- Decide whether to:

  - Keep them
  - Transform them
  - Remove them

- Justify your decision

---

### 9️. Feature Engineering

- Create **new meaningful features** from existing ones
- Examples:

  - Aggregations
  - Ratios
  - Bucketing / binning

- Explain how these features add value

---

### 10. Final Insights & Recommendations

- Summarize **key findings** clearly
- Answer your original problem questions
- Provide:

  - Data-driven conclusions
  - Practical recommendations

---

## Visualization Requirements

- **Minimum: 15 visualizations**
- Must include a mix of:

  - Bar charts
  - Histograms
  - Box plots
  - Scatter plots
  - Heatmaps or advanced plots

Each visualization should:

- Have a title
- Be readable
- Be explained in text

---

## Final Deliverables

### 1️. Jupyter Notebook (Main File)

Your notebook **must include**:

- Problem definition
- Data loading
- Data cleaning
- Univariate, bivariate & multivariate analysis
- Correlation study
- Outlier detection
- Feature engineering
- Final insights & recommendations
- Minimum **15 visualizations**

---

### 2️. README.md

This file should contain:

- Dataset description
- Project objective
- Tools & libraries used
- Summary of key insights

---

## Evaluation Criteria

You will be evaluated on:

- Structure & completeness
- Quality of analysis
- Clarity of explanations
- Visualization quality
- Insight depth (not just plots)
- Professional presentation

---

Good luck!
